## Description
This is an example of a basic landing page, implementation of which does not take much time. The major time-saving aspect is the use of the SASS(SCSS) preprocessor. Not only was it helpful nesting-wise, but it also simplified the process of making media queries.
The design is simple and clean. The main focus is on the pictures, which are of big importance for the potential clients of the agency.
